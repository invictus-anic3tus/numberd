# About the Project

Number'd was suggested to me by my little sister. She wanted a website that could easily translate between Roman Numerals and standard base 10 numbers. I expanded on her idea, incorporating Greek Numerals and the alternate bases, as explained above.
I'm Anicetus, and I love web dev! It's fun and I love to learn more about coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web app was really fun to make, and I hope it's helpful to you!

Enjoy!
